# Registration_App
 Created registration using Retrofit with PHP and MySQL. Many of you already know that for any android application we built web services or REST APIs through which our application communicates with the backend. Retrofit is a library that makes the life easier when we need to make network operations or http calls in our application.
- Building REST APIs using SLIM 3 PHP Framework
- Making the API Calls from android Side using the Retrofit Library
- Deploying the REST API or our backend in a live server
